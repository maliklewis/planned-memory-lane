### Problem definition

After a series of discovery calls we found out a problem that our users are facing. They are having a hard time sharing their memories with friends and family. They are using a combination of social media, messaging apps, and email to share their memories. They are also using a combination of cloud storage, social media, and messaging apps to store their memories. They are looking for a solution that allows them to store and share their memories in a single place.

As a first iteration for this solution, we want to build a web application that allows users to create a memory lane and share it with friends and family. A memory lane is a collection of events that happened in a chronological order. Each event consists of a title, a description, a timestamp, and at least one image.

## High level explanantion of my implementation

### Architecture
I have implemented a simple arcticture of CRUD capabilities for memories

### UI
I have frame the UI in an extremely basic manor, displaying memories in chronological order, with a header to either create a new memory or return to the "home" page to view all memories already stored in the DB.

### Next steps
The next steps I would take would be:

- Feature implementation:
    - Authn/Authz flow
    - Support for multiple images
    - Sharing memories within the platform
- UI:
    - Enhanced styling
